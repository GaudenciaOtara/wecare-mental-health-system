	<h2>The Therapists and Therapist Services</h2>
	<p>The Platform may be used to connect you with a Therapist who will provide services to you through the Platform ("Therapist Services").</p>

	<h3>For US based Therapists</h3>
	<p>We require every Therapist providing Therapist Services on the Platform to be an accredited, trained, and experienced licensed psychologist (PhD / PsyD), licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT), licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed professional counselor (LPC), or similar applicable recognized professional certification based on their state and/or jurisdiction. Therapists must have a relevant academic degree in their field, at least 3 years of experience, at least 1,000 hours of hands-on experience, and have to be qualified and certified by their respective professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice requirements as applicable.</p>

	<h3>For U.K. based Therapists</h3>
	<p>We require every Therapist providing Therapist Services on the Platform to be a credentialled, trained, and experienced Practitioner Psychologist, Counsellor, or similar applicable recognized professional certification. Therapists must have a relevant academic degree in their field, at least 3 years of experience, and have to be qualified by and credentialled by their respective professional organization after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training, and practice requirements as applicable.</p>

	<h3>For all Therapists</h3>
	<p>The Therapists are independent providers who are neither our employees nor agents nor representatives. The Platform's role is limited to enabling the Therapist Services. The Therapists themselves are responsible for the performance of the Therapy Services. If you feel the Therapist Services provided by the Therapist do not fit your needs or expectations, you may change to a different Therapist who provides services through the Platform. While we have a large database of Therapists, you should note that because of licensure requirements that differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, not all Therapists available on our database will be available for you to match with, or at any particular time, or for any set period of time. If a Therapist you have been connected with stops using the Platform at any time after you have been connected, we will send an email to notify you that your Therapist is no longer on the Platform and that you have the opportunity to match with a new Therapist.</p>

	<p>While we hope the Therapist Services are beneficial to you, you understand,
         agree and acknowledge that they may not be the appropriate solution for everyone's 
         needs and that they may not be appropriate for every particular situation and/or may 
         not be a complete substitute for a face-to-face examination and/or care in every 
         particular situation.</p>

	<p>IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE OR IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING HARMING YOURSELF OR OTHERS OR IF YOU FEEL THAT ANY OTHER PERSON MAY BE IN ANY DANGER OR IF YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES NUMBER AND NOTIFY THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES 
        (click here for a link to emergency and crisis resources in your area). 
        THE PLATFORM IS NOT DESIGNED FOR USE IN ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CASES 
        AND THE THERAPISTS CANNOT PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED IN ANY OF THE AFORE</p>

<h3>Third Party Content</h3>
<p>The Platform may contain other content, products or services which are offered or provided by third parties ("Third Party Content"), links to Third Party Content (including but not limited to links to other websites) or advertisements which are related to Third Party Content. We have no responsibility for the creation of any such Third Party Content, including (but not limited to) any related products, practices, terms or policies, and we will not be liable for any damage or loss caused by any Third Party Content.

Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE US AND AGREE TO HOLD US HARMLESS FROM ANY AND ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND CLAIMS OF ANY NATURE RESULTING FROM THE THERAPIST SERVICES OR THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY ACT, OMISSION, OPINION, RESPONSE, ADVICE, SUGGESTION, INFORMATION AND/OR SERVICE OF ANY THERAPIST AND/OR ANY OTHER CONTENT OR INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM.

YOU UNDERSTAND, AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SECURITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ACCURACY.

This section (limitation of liability) shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
